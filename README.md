Bastet
======
Bastet is a lightweight, component-focused static site builder. She is also the Ancient Egyptian goddess of cats, dancing, music and love, and therefore the perfect development companion.

# Getting started

```
npm install -g bastet
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
bastet create site --name my-site
```

A basic structure and a `README.md` with further instructions will be generated for you.
